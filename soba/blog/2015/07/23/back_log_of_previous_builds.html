					<h1>Back log of previous builds</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					To kick things off, there are already a few builds in the archive available. I'd
					been posting about this from <a href="https://twitter.com/_stephencarmody">Twitter</a>
					and linking to an IndieDB blog, but having decided to move away from that and just
					manage my own blog on <a href="https://www.github.com/stephencarmody/soba">Github</a>,
					I needed to catch up on those posts.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="../../../../builds/0.1.0/">Build 0.1.0</a>
					renders a few grasses and trees arranged in clumps around and a player character.
					You can click to move the character with all objects in the scene being
					correctly z-sorted to overlap when when in front of other objects.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<a href="../../../../builds/0.2.0/">Build 0.2.0</a> adds
					none centred anchors for the sprites and experiments with
					collision boxes and path finding. While path finding at this time was not working
					well enough to turn on, I choose to leave the display of collision boxes on, to show
					what I'm looking at. This build also sees the addition of rocks and a paved starting
					area.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="../../../../builds/0.3.0/">Build 0.3.0</a> turns
					on the path finding I'd been working on. At this tage it was still very clunky. The
					painted debug areas changed at this time from sprite overlays to tinted cells of a
					massive grid that respresents the collision space of the scene. Red highlights
					inaccessible areas, blue evaluated paths and green navigation points. Only the first
					navigation point on the path is moved to at this time, and path evaluation still
					needs some work.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="../../../../builds/0.3.1/">Build 0.3.1</a> fixes
					some issues I found in the path finding. There was nothing else new added to this
					build, I just felt after working on the path finding some more, I'd get it out and
					move on to other things.
