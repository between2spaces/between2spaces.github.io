				<p>
					SOBA is a wholehearted attempt at making a playable game for once in my life.
					For too long, I've started, stopped, and started again project after project,
					all never to see the light of day. With SOBA, I'm going to try and break that
					habit and be the author of something that someone other than myself has played.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because itâ€™s built in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, SOBA runs in a modern browser on
					any platform. SOBA will be an ARPG style single player game with no server-side
					requirements other than HTTP service to serve static assets. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A method I'm going to employ to maintain my interest is releasing often. Even if
					there is only the smallest of updates or bug fixes, I'd like to maintain a steady
					output of incremental builds. I also endeavour to maintain an archive of builds,
					with all versions from the first the current being easily accessible.
