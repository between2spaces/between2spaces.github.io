					<a href="../../../../builds/0.4.0/">Build 0.4.0</a> brings path finding experimentation
					and tuning to an end, so I've turned off the collision boxes and path debugging. I
					didn't realise but a large contributor to the performance was the display of path
					debugging, so with that turned off its surprisingly quite smooth.
				</p>

					I've also started ensuring the game works in Firefox, as well as my browser of choice
					Chrome. Didn't realise there were a few "let" and "document.evaluate" statements
					causing Firefox	to throw up its hands.

					Oh yeah there's something new to see... the message window! Yay, and I've cut back
					the map objects a bit because I've been playing around with how to discribe the map
					in a format that a future map editor might be able to maintain.
