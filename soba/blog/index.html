					Wow it's been over a month and not much has happend on SOBA in that time. I sort of lost
					the time and then the frame of mind to do any thing constructive. I wish it hadn't
					been so long, but alas it has. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm still working on a 0.5.0 build. So far all I've managed to do is migrate to
					<a href="https://github.com/rollup/rollup">Rollup</a> for module bundling and a small
					amount of code cleanup around a unified event/updater system.

				<p>
					<a href="../builds/0.4.0/">Build 0.4.0</a> brings path finding experimentation
					and tuning to an end, so I've turned off the collision boxes and path debugging. I
					didn't realise but a large contributor to the performance was the display of path
					debugging, so with that turned off its surprisingly quite smooth.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've also started ensuring the game works in Firefox, as well as my browser of choice
					Chrome. Didn't realise there were a few "let" and "document.evaluate" statements
					causing Firefox	to throw up its hands. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh yeah there's something new to see... the message window! Yay, and I've cut back
					the map objects a bit because I've been playing around with how to discribe the map
					in a format that a future map editor might be able to maintain.

					To kick things off, there are already a few builds in the archive available. I'd
					been posting about this from <a href="https://twitter.com/_stephencarmody">Twitter</a>
					and linking to an IndieDB blog, but having decided to move away from that and just
					manage my own blog on <a href="https://www.github.com/stephencarmody/soba">Github</a>,
					I needed to catch up on those posts.

				<p>
					<a href="../builds/0.1.0/">Build 0.1.0</a>
					renders a few grasses and trees arranged in clumps around and a player character.
					You can click to move the character with all objects in the scene being
					correctly z-sorted to overlap when when in front of other objects.
				</p>
				<p> 
					<a href="../builds/0.2.0/">Build 0.2.0</a> adds
					none centred anchors for the sprites and experiments with
					collision boxes and path finding. While path finding at this time was not working
					well enough to turn on, I choose to leave the display of collision boxes on, to show
					what I'm looking at. This build also sees the addition of rocks and a paved starting
					area.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="../builds/0.3.0/">Build 0.3.0</a> turns
					on the path finding I'd been working on. At this tage it was still very clunky. The
					painted debug areas changed at this time from sprite overlays to tinted cells of a
					massive grid that respresents the collision space of the scene. Red highlights
					inaccessible areas, blue evaluated paths and green navigation points. Only the first
					navigation point on the path is moved to at this time, and path evaluation still
					needs some work.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="../builds/0.3.1/">Build 0.3.1</a> fixes
					some issues I found in the path finding. There was nothing else new added to this
					build, I just felt after working on the path finding some more, I'd get it out and
					move on to other things.

				<p>
					SOBA is a wholehearted attempt at making a playable game for once in my life.
					For too long, I've started, stopped, and started again project after project,
					all never to see the light of day. With SOBA, I'm going to try and break that
					habit and be the author of something that someone other than myself has played.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because itâ€™s built in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, SOBA runs in a modern browser on
					any platform. SOBA will be an ARPG style single player game with no server-side
					requirements other than HTTP service to serve static assets. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A method I'm going to employ to maintain my interest is releasing often. Even if
					there is only the smallest of updates or bug fixes, I'd like to maintain a steady
					output of incremental builds. I also endeavour to maintain an archive of builds,
					with all versions from the first the current being easily accessible.
